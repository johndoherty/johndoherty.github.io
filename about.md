Hi, my name is John. I work as Software Engineer at Magic Leap working on production computer vision.
In my free time I like to learn, read, write (primarily C++ and English), and be outside. 

I hope to keep this blog up-to-date with things I learn and find interesting. Honestly, I don't expect
many people to stumble upon this so it will mainly be for my own future reference. But if people
do manage to find this site and find it useful, I will be sure to quickly put up a paywall.
